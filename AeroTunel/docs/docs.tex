The area $A$ of the tunnel is calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:

\begin{equation}
A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2
\end{equation}

where $d$ is the diameter of the tunnel.

The effective power $P_{\text{eff}}$ is the product of the power $P$ and the efficiency $\eta$ of the propeller:

\begin{equation}
P_{\text{eff}} = P \cdot \eta
\end{equation}

The velocity $v$ of the air in the tunnel is calculated using the formula for the power of wind, rearranged to solve for $v$:

$$P = \frac{1}{2} \rho A v^3$$
\begin{equation}
v = \left(\frac{2 P_{\text{eff}}}{\rho A}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ is the air density, assumed to be $1.2 \, \text{kg/m}^3$ at sea level and $20^\circ \text{C}$.
