\section{Tuturials}
Well the simulations here are not as simple to make as in Solid, this is a very complex tool. 
But all you need to know(probably) is in those two tutorials made by Hindu men. Always belive
in Hindu men when it comes to Ansys.

\end{itemize}
Also Kacper got a lot of help from labolatories in the university. Overall Kacper is 
the one working with Ansys, so if you have any questions, ask him.
