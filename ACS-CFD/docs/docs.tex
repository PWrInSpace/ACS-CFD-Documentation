\section{Full heatmap parametric study for different velocities}
This study was done on computing claster, for which we are very gratefull for. This
allowed us to do a very large parametric study, which would be impossible to do on a single
PC. The results are presented in the following pages.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Parameters of this study were canard angles in range of -30 to 30 with step of 5 degrees and
    velocities of 34, 68, 102 m/s. 
    \item Mesh was pretty good with 80k cells. It was also made in a way, which we 
    found to be the giving closest results to the very fine mesh.
    \item In total $13 \times 13 \times 3 = 507$ simulations were done. This is 20\% of the 
    minimal version of full parametric study for Sternik 1.5.
\end{enumerate}
The goal of this study was to generate accurate heatmaps of forces and moments for Sternik 1.5, 
but also to study the influence of Mach number on the aerodynamic coefficients. Thanks 
to never before seen quality of the results, it is possible to see the very non-linear 
nature of the aerodynamic coefficients of such project.
